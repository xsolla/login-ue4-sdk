<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p>
Login & Account System plug-in is already included as part of the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/xsolla-store-sdk">Game Commerce</a> plug-in. You can download the Game Commerce if you need a broader set of features, but do <b>NOT</b> install these plugins separately.
